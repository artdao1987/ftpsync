ftpsync - synchronizes a directory with an FTP host efficiently.

h1. SYNOPSIS

**ftpsync** -h

**ftpsync** [-n]

h1. DESCRIPTION

**ftpsync** is a program that sincronizes all files beneath the current directory with an FTP host efficiently.

The destination host is identified by a _.ftp_upstream_ in the current directory that must have the following line:

pre. 
upstream=ftp://user@host/path



The password is found by looking at _~/.netrc_, see **netrc**(5).

ftpsync sends all files in the current directory to the target host, and stores the MD5 of the sent files in a _hashes.txt_ files in the remote host. When syncing again, it checks the MD5 of each file against the one stored in the remote _hashes.txt_ file, and only sends the files that are different. This makes ftpsync very efficient when synchronizing a directory with only a few different files, as long as they are always sent by ftpsync.

h1. OPTIONS

**-h** Help.

**-q** Quiet mode.
