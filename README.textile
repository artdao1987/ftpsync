ftpsync - synchronizes a directory with an FTP host efficiently.

h1. SYNOPSIS

**ftpsync** [options]

h1. DESCRIPTION

**ftpsync** is a program that synchronizes all files beneath the current directory with an FTP host efficiently.

The destination host is identified by a _.ftp_upstream_ in the current directory that must have the following line:

pre. 
ftp://user@host/path



The password is found by looking at _~/.netrc_, see "**netrc**(5)":netrc.
If netrc is unavailable, then gnome-keyring take over. For more information about gnome-keyring, please refer "to the wiki":http://wiki.github.com/xrogaan/ftpsync/.

ftpsync sends all files in the current directory to the target host, and stores the MD5 of the sent files in a _hashes.txt_ files in the remote host. When syncing again, it checks the MD5 of each file against the one stored in the remote _hashes.txt_ file, and only sends the files that are different. This makes ftpsync very efficient when synchronizing a directory with only a few different files, as long as they are always sent by ftpsync.



h1. OPTIONS

**-h** Show the help then exit.
**-q** Quiet mode.
**-s** Safe mode: sends hashes.txt after every successful file transfer.
